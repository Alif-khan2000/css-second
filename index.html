                    Google Code Red alarm seems to be paying off. The Google Bard AI chatbot can deliver responses to questionnaires that are provided in the form of text thanks to a set of deep learning algorithms known as “large language models.” Google’s Bard AI is built on LaMDA technology and is programmed to use the web to get the “most recent” responses to questions that are asked.
                    Bard AI is an experimental service for conversational AI that the company developed. Bard AI improves its performance based on the interactions it has with humans.
                    At this time, only a select few individuals have access to the Google Bard AI link to conduct tests. Google is building a “lightweight model version of LaMDA” to cut down on the amount of time and energy spent on computing.
                    It is intended to provide answers to difficult issues in a format that is simple to understand and can assist with activities such as the organization of a baby shower, the rating of movies, and the generation of ideas for lunch. But like any AI-powered tool, Bard AI can make mistakes, and it did recently. The interesting thing is the mistake was in the ad.
                    Google’s Bard AI is one of the most promising AI search engines, even though it failed.

                    The Microsoft Bing AI chatbot is an integrated artificial intelligence that is powered by GPT 
                    (the same technology that powers ChatGPT). It was recently revealed that the most recent generation of Microsoft’s 
                    Bing AI search engine would be powered by an upgraded version of the same artificial intelligence (AI) technology
                    that ChatGPT applies. Microsoft is releasing the product alongside updated artificial intelligence
                    (AI) capabilities for its Edge web browser, with the promise that together they will revolutionize
                    the user’s experience of surfing the web and researching topics of interest.
